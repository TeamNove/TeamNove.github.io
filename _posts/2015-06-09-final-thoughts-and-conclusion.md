We finished our web application and just gave the final presentation today.
For those interested here is the link to our [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13M0-crgukyTW3CIWLWf5jVuWEoz1dlC8WAQRcSpjivw/edit?usp=sharing)

Our web application is hosted here: [http://teamnove.herokuapp.com/](http://teamnove.herokuapp.com/) and you can find our source code here: [https://github.com/TeamNove/webapp](https://github.com/TeamNove/webapp).

We were able to finish all the main goals we wanted to do with this project including:

+ D3.js map overlay onto Google Maps
+ Allowing users to select filters on what they cared most about when searching for an area to live.
+ Creating a scale that would show users which regions matched their criteria.
+ Leap Motion gestures.

Looking ahead to what would make our application better:

+ More datasets (crime, updated housing regions, etc.) so that users are able to filter and narrow in on what matters to them
+ Currently our Leap Motion gestures only interact with Google Maps, but it would be interesting to see how we could implement a different menu that leverages Leap Motion use, such as a radial menu.
+ Allow users to filter based on education, housing, and social factors instead of having to fill out the selection inputs in the sidebar. This would create a more general version of our application, but it would be a nice feature to have.

Thanks for reading!
