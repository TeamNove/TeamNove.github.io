We have decided to come up with a new idea for our project. Instead of using Zillow housing data, we want to create a web application which displays a map of San Diego, and segmented by city, displays housing dynamics. Figures such as single household vs. family households, available education, and cost of living will be displayed in an informative manner such that the target user base can determine if an area they are planning to move into is family-friendly or not.

Target users: People looking to move somewhere in San Diego conscious of family-friendly environments
